# User Analysis and 5G-User Prediction in Telecom Industry Based on Data Mining

**Language:** Python

**Platform:** PyCharm

## Overview

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology officially issued a 5G commercial license in June 2019, which marked the entry of the 5G era in Chinese telecom. With the maturity of data mining technology, it has a good application prospect in telecom. Based on the large number of user data mastered by operators, data mining is one of the most significant factors which could help them remain competitive, achieving precision marketing and setting market shares. Therefore, this paper puts forward the research question named 5G-User prediction and user analysis.

This paper conducts customer segmentation, builds a 5G-User prediction model, and mines the association rule of user behavior using data provided by an operator. At the preparation stage, the original data set has been preprocessed by data cleaning, data integration, data transformation, and feature selection so as to transform the original data set into a sample data set that can be used for data mining. At the data mining stage, the K-means algorithm has been used to achieve customer segmentation and screen out potential 5G users who use numbers frequently, owe less, and have a high degree of network dependence from three dimensions: user type, number usage, and arrears. After the contrast experiment of six classification algorithms, the decision tree algorithm has been chosen to predict 5G users, and classification visualization has been realized. In addition, this paper uses the Apriori algorithm to conduct an association analysis of user behavior, mining out strong association rules between the selection of user packages, number usage, and arrears. At last, marketing suggestions have been given based on the association rules mining results.

The paper combines social context with data mining, building a 5G-User prediction model and user behavior analysis model, which could provide valuable information for marketers and decision-makers. It is significant for operators to achieve precision marketing and expand the user scale.
